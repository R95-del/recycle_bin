# RecycleBin üóëÔ∏è

A simple and elegant soft delete solution for Rails applications with a beautiful web interface to manage your deleted records.

**RecycleBin** provides a "trash can" or "recycle bin" functionality where deleted records are marked as deleted instead of being permanently removed from your database. You can easily restore them or permanently delete them through a clean web interface.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Soft Delete**: Records are marked as deleted instead of being permanently removed
- **Web Interface**: Beautiful, responsive dashboard to view and manage deleted items
- **Easy Integration**: Simple module inclusion in your models
- **Bulk Operations**: Restore or permanently delete multiple items at once
- **Model Filtering**: Filter deleted items by model type and time
- **Rails Generators**: Automated setup with generators
- **Configurable**: Flexible configuration options
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Overview of your deleted items

## Installation üì¶

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'recycle_bin'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install recycle_bin
```

## Quick Setup üöÄ

### 1. Run the install generator

```bash
$ rails generate recycle_bin:install
```

This will:
- Create a configuration file at `config/initializers/recycle_bin.rb`
- Add the mount point to your routes
- Display setup instructions

### 2. Add deleted_at column to your models

For each model you want to soft delete, run:

```bash
$ rails generate recycle_bin:add_deleted_at ModelName
```

For example:
```bash
$ rails generate recycle_bin:add_deleted_at User
$ rails generate recycle_bin:add_deleted_at Post
$ rails generate recycle_bin:add_deleted_at Comment
```

This generates a migration to add the `deleted_at` column and index.

### 3. Run the migrations

```bash
$ rails db:migrate
```

### 4. Include the module in your models

Add `RecycleBin::SoftDeletable` to any model you want to soft delete:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include RecycleBin::SoftDeletable
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  include RecycleBin::SoftDeletable
end

class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  include RecycleBin::SoftDeletable
end
```

### 5. Visit the web interface

Navigate to `/recycle_bin` in your Rails application to see the web interface!

## Usage üí°

### Basic Operations

Once you've included the `RecycleBin::SoftDeletable` module in your models:

```ruby
# Create a record
user = User.create(name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com")

# Soft delete (goes to trash)
user.destroy
# or
user.soft_delete

# Check if deleted
user.deleted? # => true

# Restore from trash
user.restore

# Permanently delete (careful!)
user.destroy!
```

### Querying Records

The module provides several useful scopes:

```ruby
# Get all active (non-deleted) records (default scope)
User.all

# Get only deleted records
User.deleted

# Get all records including deleted ones
User.with_deleted

# Get only deleted records (alias)
User.only_deleted

# Get non-deleted records explicitly
User.not_deleted

# Restore a deleted record by ID
User.restore(123)
```

### Web Interface Features

The web interface (`/recycle_bin`) provides:

- **Dashboard Overview**: Statistics about deleted items
- **Item Listing**: View all deleted records with details
- **Filtering**: Filter by model type (User, Post, Comment, etc.)
- **Time Filters**: View items deleted today, this week, or this month
- **Individual Actions**: Restore or permanently delete single items
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple items to restore or delete
- **Item Details**: Click on any item to see full details and history

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Configure RecycleBin in `config/initializers/recycle_bin.rb`:

```ruby
RecycleBin.configure do |config|
  # Enable/disable web interface (default: true)
  config.enable_web_interface = true

  # Items per page in web interface (default: 25)
  config.items_per_page = 50

  # Auto-cleanup items after specified time (default: nil - disabled)
  config.auto_cleanup_after = 30.days

  # Method to get current user for audit trail (default: :current_user)
  config.current_user_method = :current_user

  # Authorization callback - restrict access to admins only
  config.authorize_with do |controller|
    # Example: Only allow admins
    controller.current_user&.admin?
  end
end
```

### Authorization

To restrict access to the web interface, use the `authorize_with` configuration:

```ruby
RecycleBin.configure do |config|
  config.authorize_with do |controller|
    # Only allow admins
    controller.current_user&.admin?
  end
end
```

If authorization fails, users will be redirected with an "Access denied" message.

## Advanced Usage üîß

### Custom Title Display

By default, RecycleBin tries to use `title`, `name`, or `email` fields for display. You can customize this:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include RecycleBin::SoftDeletable

  def recyclable_title
    "#{first_name} #{last_name} (#{email})"
  end
end
```

### Associations and Dependencies

RecycleBin works with Rails associations. The web interface will show related items:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include RecycleBin::SoftDeletable
  has_many :posts, dependent: :destroy
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  include RecycleBin::SoftDeletable
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
end
```

### Statistics and Reporting

Get statistics about your deleted items:

```ruby
# Get overall statistics
RecycleBin.stats
# => { deleted_items: 45, models_with_soft_delete: ["User", "Post", "Comment"] }

# Count deleted items across all models
RecycleBin.count_deleted_items # => 45

# Get models that have soft delete enabled
RecycleBin.models_with_soft_delete # => ["User", "Post", "Comment"]
```

## Troubleshooting üîç

### Common Issues

**1. "uninitialized constant RecycleBin" error**
- Make sure you've added the gem to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`
- Restart your Rails server

**2. Routes not working**
- Ensure you've run `rails generate recycle_bin:install`
- Check that `mount RecycleBin::Engine => '/recycle_bin'` is in your `config/routes.rb`

**3. Records not appearing in trash**
- Verify you've included `RecycleBin::SoftDeletable` in your model
- Ensure the `deleted_at` column exists (run the migration)
- Check that you're calling `.destroy` not `.delete`

**4. Web interface shows "Access denied"**
- Check your authorization configuration in the initializer
- Ensure the current user meets your authorization requirements

### Debugging

Enable debug logging to see what's happening:

```ruby
# In development.rb or console
Rails.logger.level = :debug
```
